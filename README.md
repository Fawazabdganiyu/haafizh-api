# Haafizh Backend (GraphQL API)

## Overview

This is the **backend service** for [Haafizh](https://github.com/your-username/haafizh), a secure, user-friendly application for recording, tracking, and managing personal or shared funds.

The backend is built with **NestJS** and exposes a **GraphQL API** powered by **Apollo Server**. It manages authentication, contacts, transactions, and balance calculations while connecting to a **PostgreSQL** database.

ðŸ‘‰ Frontend Repository: [Haafizh (Next.js)](https://github.com/your-username/haafizh)
